If you want to run the .m file, and walk through each question and section, there's a handy button called "Run and Advance" in the Editor tab that'll run the current section/question, then jump to the next. Great for running the script in small portions.

I've also incuded the Live Script I used to generate that nice PDF, if you want a more interactive way to run the main .m file.
